beta_1.0 added character management

beta_1.1 added bot and map 

beta_1.2 fix bugs

beta_1.3 add menu and colors menu

beta_1.4 added how many points he wants on the player map and a new category in the menu called "Setting" in which the number of spawn points changes. Everything is broken down by function

#Release
V2.0 has completely updated the menu, fixed all the bugs in the code without a single "goto", everything is designed much better than before, and it's definitely not a beta version anymore
